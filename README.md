# Credit-Risk-Analysis-for-Extending-Bank-Loans

Developed a machine learning model to predict loan defaults using imbalanced banking data. Addressed class imbalance with the SMOTE technique to improve the model's ability to identify defaults. Implemented Logistic Regression, achieving 74% accuracy and an 83% F1-score as a baseline. Advanced to XGBoost for improved performance, achieving a 91% F1-score after fine-tuning with Grid Search CV. The model helps banks make data-driven decisions, reducing financial risk while maintaining profitability.
